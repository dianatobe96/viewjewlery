I'm used my first project. In the CSS code, I've mostly kept the original from my first project, but I have made some changes. I updated the background color and moved the message popup to the gift section on the navbar. In the sidebar, I modified the JavaScript code for the button that deletes items, aside from changing the item names.

I added EJS files for home.ejs, about.ejs, and contact.ejs. These files contain information and cards about the company. In the contact.ejs file, I created a form so that users can send messages. In the server file, I created a route to display the user's information and message on another page.
